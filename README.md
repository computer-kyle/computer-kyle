***Featured Projects***

ðŸ’¾ [DiskBlocks](https://github.com/computer-kyle/DiskBlocks): A GUI application for Windows that analyzes disk space usage, and provides a visual representation of file and directory sizes. It is written in C++ and uses multithreading, recursion, and tree structures for optimal performance and memory utilization.

ðŸ”‘ [crypng](https://github.com/computer-kyle/crypng): A digital image LSB Steganography program that uses a unique pipeline for improved secrecy of encoded messages over other techniques. Written in C++ and uses ImGui, stb_image, tiny-AES-c, and OpenGL.
